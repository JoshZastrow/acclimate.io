            Manufacturing is positioned to see enormous disruption from applied
            A.I research. Image recognition tools for automating and enhancing
            visual defect inspections, Anomaly detection on the product floor
            for preventing unscheduled downtime, or a learned scheduling agent
            for predicting lead times and scheduling start dates can drastically
            improve your physical processes.

            and improve over time.

            Would you like a better understanding the trends in your product
            line, and the segments of customers who like to shop with you? What
            aspects of your offerings keep customers coming back and staying?
            Todayâ€™s technology can optimize the shopping experience for each
            unique customer. Image Recognition systems can draw new insight from
            your product line, and these features combined with customer
            activity can drive recommendation engines that dramatically increase
            your sales.

            Delivering a diagnosis takes considerable energy from specialists
            with limited time. Modern learning algorithms can use visual
            understanding of patient scans to assist in screening and deliver
            insights that extend the capabilities of your clinicians. Deliver
            more accurate diagnoses to a larger patient base in less time.
